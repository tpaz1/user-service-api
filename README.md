# user-service-api
In this tutorial we are going to build an `api` using `NodeJS` with `ExpressJS` framework and then we are going to build a `Dockerfile` our api and run containers from it.
### Pre requirements
* `NodeJS` [installed](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* `Docker` [installed](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* `ExpressJS` [installed](http://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html)

The api that we are building is for a simple ExpressJS app that simply has one endpoint and returns list of users.
After that we will build a [Dockerfile](https://github.com/tpaz1/user-service-api/blob/main/Dockerfile) that will allow us to produce a Docker image
